	<description>Prevents all filth in the game, including those added by other mods.

- This mod does NOT impact performance because it ONLY shortly performs work during game startup.
- This mod doesn't remove existing filth that you may already have before adding this mod.
- Note that firefoam is technically also filth which means that it kills the fire and the foam vanishes instantly afterwards.
- Is safe to add/remove from/to an existing game.</description>
